# Public Assets Folder

This folder contains example assets for your portfolio. Copy this entire folder to `public/` and replace the example files with your own assets.

## Required Files

### Images
- `portrait.jpg` - Your profile photo (recommended: 400x400px or similar square aspect ratio)
- Project images referenced in your `projects.json` file

### Documents (Optional)
- PDF files like resumes, certificates, etc.
- Audio files for projects with audio components
- Video files for project previews

### Project Assets
Add any images, videos, or documents that your projects reference. Make sure the file names match what you use in your `projects.json` file.

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for consistency (e.g., `my-project-banner.png`)
- Keep file names descriptive but concise
- For project images, consider using the project ID as a prefix (e.g., `vernato-screenshot.png`)

## Optimization Tips

- Compress images to reduce file sizes
- Use appropriate formats (WebP for modern browsers, JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency)
- Consider using a CDN or image hosting service for better performance
