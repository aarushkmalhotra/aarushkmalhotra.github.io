## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#7000F4) to convey innovation and sophistication.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern aesthetic in light mode, transitioning to dark grey (#171A1C) in dark mode, for eye comfort.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FFB347) to draw attention to key interactive elements such as links and call-to-action buttons.
- Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clarity and readability, ensuring a modern, accessible reading experience.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) to give it a tech-y edge, contrasting with body copy.
- Employ Heroicons for a consistent, professional, and easily recognizable visual language throughout the site. Match line weights to ensure icons don't appear too heavy.
- Implement a responsive grid layout for adaptability across devices. Employ well-defined sections with consistent spacing to enhance the user experience.
- Subtle fade-in animations upon page load to add a smooth, refined touch, avoiding flashy transitions. Interactive elements should use tasteful hover states for increased user feedback.
