In an era of complex web applications, there's a certain beauty in the simplicity and power of static sites. Static Site Generation (SSG) is a technique where the entire website is pre-built into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during a build process.

The benefits are numerous:

**Performance:** With no server-side rendering or database queries at request time, static sites are incredibly fast. The content is served directly from a CDN, leading to near-instant load times.

**Security:** The attack surface is dramatically reduced. Since there's no live database or server-side code executing on user requests, many common vulnerabilities are simply not a concern.

**Scalability & Cost:** Static files are easy to cache and distribute globally via a CDN. This makes them highly scalable and often cheaper to host than dynamic applications.

Frameworks like Next.js have made SSG more powerful than ever, allowing for rich, interactive experiences without sacrificing the core benefits of a static architecture. This portfolio is a perfect example, deployed on GitHub Pages as a fully static site.
