Building a developer portfolio is a rite of passage. It's not just a resume; it's a living project that showcases your skills, style, and philosophy as an engineer. For a long time, my old portfolio was a simple static HTML page. It served its purpose, but it didn't reflect the kind of work I love to do.

I decided it was time for a change. My goals were clear:

*   **Modern Technology:** I wanted to use a modern, performant stack. Next.js with the App Router was a clear choice for its speed, developer experience, and static export capabilities.
*   **Developer-First Design:** The design had to be clean, professional, and put the focus on the projects. Tailwind CSS was perfect for this, allowing for rapid, utility-first styling.
*   **Extensibility:** I needed a simple way to add new projects and blog posts without touching a line of code. Using JSON for projects and Markdown for blog posts makes content management a breeze.

This rebuild was more than just a technical exercise. It was a chance to rethink how I present my work and to create a platform that I'm genuinely excited to share.
