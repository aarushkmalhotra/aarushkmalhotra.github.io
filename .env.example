NEXT_PUBLIC_HERO_DESCRIPTION="I'm a CS student who builds things that fix whatever's bothering me. Usually that means making complicated stuff actually make sense."
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABOUT_TITLE="Hey, I'm [Your Name]."
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABOUT_DESCRIPTION="I'm studying Computer Science at [Your University], but honestly, most of what I know comes from building stuff that annoys me less than whatever already exists. I've moved around a lot - way too many countries, way too many school systems. Each move taught me that things are usually more complicated than they need to be.|I get bothered by broken things. Not just code that doesn't work, but experiences that make people feel stupid or frustrated. So I end up building tools to fix whatever's driving me crazy. I'm always down to chat with people who think technology should actually help instead of just being impressive."
